Customer acquisition cost in iGaming usually rises when channels are managed in isolation. Affiliate managers optimize for deal volume, while paid media teams optimize for click efficiency. The result is duplicated testing, inconsistent traffic quality, and delayed learning loops.

The fastest way to improve CAC is to run affiliate and media buying under one operating model with shared KPIs.

## Start with one CAC definition

Many teams track different CAC versions by channel. That makes budget decisions harder and slows scaling.

Set one weekly CAC model for all traffic sources:

- Net acquisition cost by source
- First deposit conversion rate
- Cost per qualified player (not just cost per registration)
- Early retention signal (for example D7 activity)

Once this is aligned, both affiliate and paid media decisions point to the same commercial outcome.

## Use a joint testing backlog

Most CAC waste comes from unstructured testing. Build one backlog that both channel owners share:

1. Target market hypothesis
2. Offer and landing page hypothesis
3. Creative angle hypothesis
4. Publisher or placement hypothesis

This approach prevents overlap and turns each test into reusable insight. A winning landing page in paid social can become an affiliate pre-sell template. A high-performing affiliate angle can become paid creative copy.

## Route traffic by quality, not by volume

In iGaming, cheap traffic often hides expensive outcomes. Introduce quality gates before scaling spend:

- Minimum first deposit conversion threshold
- Fraud and duplicate account checks
- Player value proxies by geo and source
- Controlled scale rules by publisher and campaign

When quality gates are clear, CAC improves because poor segments are paused early instead of absorbing budget for weeks.

## Build a weekly optimization rhythm

Create one weekly review across affiliate and media buying:

- Keep: tests with stable CAC and acceptable quality
- Fix: tests with potential but weak conversion flow
- Cut: segments that fail quality gates after the testing window

This rhythm keeps teams focused on decisions, not reporting noise. It also helps leadership reallocate budget faster into channels that compound results.

## Practical rollout for growth teams

If your current setup is fragmented, start with a 30-day pilot:

1. Choose one priority market
2. Align both channels on one CAC model
3. Launch 3 to 5 coordinated tests
4. Review outcomes weekly and rebalance budget
